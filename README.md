# COMPONENTS
* Digital Lock (with injected info-leaking HW-trojan)

# TOOLS
* Verilog
* Pencil/Paper
* Xilinx Vivado (on AWS Windows 11 Workspace intance)

# STEPS
1. Handwrite original Digital Lock logic. 
2. Simplify Digital Lock logic using Karnaugh Map. 
3. Write original Digital Logic in Verilog. 
4. Demonstrate the HW-trojan in action by showing how it can leak the passkey to a connected peripheral device given a different input.
5. Explain pre and post injection mitigations (current or future).
